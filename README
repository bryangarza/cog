cog is a dead-simple script that installs AUR packages

intro
-----

Existing AUR helpers try to reinvent the wheel. This is an attempt to create a
small, readable script that leverages existing tools to install packages. Using
the excellent cower[1] and makepkg, installation is a breeze.

cog has no options (yet). This is because it is not designed to do
_everything_. cog was written to install packages only. If you need more than
that (such as retrieving information on AUR packages) see [1].
